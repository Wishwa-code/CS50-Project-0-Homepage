                    <p class="my">Hi! My name is wishwa. I'm 20 and I live in colombo which is the capital of sri lanka.
                        Actuallly I come from another city - Embilipitiya,where i spend my childhood, but after receiving schoolarship i came to study in a school in matara. Afer finishing school i joined a IT collage in colombo.
                        I have a sister - Wishmi. She is 14 and she is still going to school in my hometown. My dad teachs in school in my hometown. 
                        My mom runs a hardware business.<br>
                        I'm interested in Web developing , designing and football. Computers first appered in my life when i was ten. Then i had got my first computer.
                        It was windows pentium 4 and i remember myself thinking, that it was the best thing in the world. I was playing it whenever i could. 
                        At first, i was just playing computer games, but sometime later, i noticed that i could do lot more with the computer, for example programming.
                        Now i can already design webpages, and digital arts. I hope that in future i will get a job as a web developer.<br>
                        My favourite thing i like to do in free times is watching cartoons. My favorite cartoon is soora pappa. Still i love to watch soora pappa cartoons. I can remember almost every episode of soora pappa.
                        But i also like to watch other catroon dagaya, dagara valiga, giripura aththo. Apart from that I like to watch action and comedy movies.<br>
                        I have always been good at football. after joining new school in grade 6 i started playing football. Most of the time i used to play with people older than me.
                        I am good at defending, i think that might be reason for it. My position is left back. From the young age i always wanted to challenge right winger of the opposting team.
                        I particpated every sport meet footbal tornament and several tournaments. I am  the current vice captain of the collage football. I am willing to practice hard bring a trophie to our collage with support of my team.<br>
                        My dream is to study web developing and designing and go to canada. I love everything associated with this country, and i hope that in the future
                        i will learn english accent. I want a to get a job there as a web developer and start my own company. Currenlty i am trying to be productive in every i can do to make my dream come true.
                        I hate snakes. When i see a snake i will get to the highest place i can get.I feel like snakes are very unpredictable and they can get to anywhere real quick. I am not afraid to humans,ghost,animals,birds and when i 
                        come across a snake I think "This is the end,you stay in the highest place you can or you die".This is terrible.
